## Description

BeepBeep is an event stream processing engine. In BeepBeep, streams of events
(of any kind) are piped into computing units called *processors*. The output of
processors can be used as the input of other processors, forming potentially
complex *processor chains*.

## Creating processor chains

A first way of creating processor chains is programmatically. BeepBeep can be
used as a Java library that provides objects for creating, connecting and
running `Processor` objects.

### Example 1: Cumulative average
