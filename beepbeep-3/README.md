## Description

BeepBeep is an event stream processing engine. In BeepBeep, streams of events
(of any kind) are piped into computing units called *processors*. The output of
processors can be used as the input of other processors, forming potentially
complex *processor chains*.

## Creating processor chains

A first way of creating processor chains is programmatically. BeepBeep can be
used as a Java library that provides objects for creating, connecting and
running `Processor` objects.

### Example 1: cumulative average

See the [Java code](https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3-examples/classbasic_1_1_average.html)
that builds this processor chain.

### Example 2: keep only even numbers

See the [Java code](https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3-examples/classbasic_1_1_filter_condition_composite.html)
that builds this processor chain.

### Example 3: smoothed average over values of a JSlider

BeepBeep's event sources can be anything. In this example, a stream of numbers
is built by polling the value of a slider in a JFrame twice per second. This
stream is used to display a plot with two data series: the raw values and the
smoothed values over a sliding window of 4 events.

that builds this processor chain.
