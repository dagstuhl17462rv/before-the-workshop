## Description: Hybrid Engine Trace Analysis

Consider including the following and introducing additional structure if you want.

* My favourite specification (or two)
* A short paragraph explaining the property

	The system under monitoring is a vehicule hybrid engine.
	
	The goal is to check/compute three properties about those quantities:
		* the average consumption 
		* the max speed
		* the rate of electric power recover
		
	Those quantities but be considered not on the overall trace but per cycle. The cycle variable is identified by an integer).
	So the monitor must be able to spot cycles starts and ends and to restrict a quantity computation to a cycle.
	
	
	
	
	
* Show how to run it (if a tools exists): command line/web-based

	Just Double-Clic on ARTiMon.exe
	
* What is your formalism good at/what is missing? Application area?
* If possible, use the table from the [STTT-paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10009-017-0454-5) to self-categorize tool
