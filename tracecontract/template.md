## How are we going to use this info?

We would like to collect your input for the seminar here, publicly in the repository. The idea is that you submit your info

<p align="center"><strong>by August 15th</strong></p>

here in the repository. That will allow us to get an overview and classify the submissions/participants. It also allows you as a participant to get a quick overview on what other people are doing. This allows us to jump right into _medias res_ at the meeting and avoid lengthy introductory presentations.

As *outcome* of the seminar, we hope to ideally define a small set of interesting challenges that could be used as examples or case studies in the future. Promiment examples from other domains are the Steam Boiler, Mondex, or the CoCoME "Common Component Modelling Example".

### TODOS

* Use table from the STTT-paper (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10009-017-0454-5) to self-categorize tool here in the template [Giles]
* how to engage the other half of the participants that don't have specs or tools. Draft email to participants, taking the "How..."-section from above.
* Martin/Volker: TeSSLa-spec
* Giles: QEA-spec
* How/where do people submit their things? Naming-scheme?
