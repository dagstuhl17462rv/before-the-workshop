# Instructions for adding a Contribution

* Create a tool folder named after the tool.

* Copy `template.md` into that folder.

* In that local tool folder, rename `template.md` to `README.md`.

* Fill out the tool local `README.md` file. One can use a markdown
  editor which makes the experience much nicer.

* Possibly add other material in that folder such as source code etc.

* Make a link from the top `README.md` file to that local `README.md` file.
