# "A Shared Challenge in Behavioural Specification"
## Collection of material BEFORE the Dagstuhl seminar 

URL: http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17462

# Instructions for adding a Contribution

* Create a tool folder named after the tool.

* Copy `template.md` into that folder.

* In that local tool folder, rename `template.md` to `README.md`.

* Fill out the tool local `README.md` file. One can use a markdown
  editor which makes the experience much nicer.

* Possibly add other material in that folder such as source code, traces etc.

* Make a link from the top `README.md` file to that local `README.md` file.

# Tools and Languages

- [TraceContract](tracecontract/README.md)
- [QEA](qea/README.md)

# How are we going to use this info?

We would like to collect your input for the seminar here, publicly in the repository. The idea is that you submit your info

<p align="center"><strong>by November 1</strong></p>

here in the repository. That will allow us to get an overview and classify the submissions/participants. It also allows you as a participant to get a quick overview on what other people are doing. This allows us to jump right into _medias res_ at the meeting. Ideally, on the first day of the seminar, you will present your specification language and examples in a submitted talk.

As *outcome* of the seminar, we hope to ideally define a small set of interesting challenges that could be used as examples or case studies in the future. Promiment examples from other domains are the Steam Boiler, Mondex, or the CoCoME "Common Component Modelling Example".
